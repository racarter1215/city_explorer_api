## Overview
The purpose of this application is to provide a user with the ability to selecdt a city (Lynnwood) and get general information on it, as well as a weather report. Both are stored and accessed on a localhost server.

## Getting Started
First thing you need to do is ensure that you have npm and nodemon installed on your computer. Once that is accomplished, you need the data you will be pulling from (JSON files).
